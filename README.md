# Unity top down 3D adventure game (Work in progress)
This is a unity game project i started working on last year.
I wanted to work in a more "profesional" way, so i decided to make a git repository for it.

I still have no name for this game, right now im focused on developing the game main mechnics (These are not final):
- Character motion
- Dialogue system
- Quest system
- Inventory system
- Text library system
- Some more sub systems.

A short story for this game will began to be designd once main mechanics and systems are funcitonal.
